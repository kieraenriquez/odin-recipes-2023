    <p>The Basics with Babish french onion soup recipe takes a complicated dish and makes it slightly more manageable and infinitely more delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3lbs Spanish onions (yields 4 servings)</li>
        <li>6 cups high quality beef stock (or amped up store bought stock)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp flour</li>
        <li>1 cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>Soy sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>Fish sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>Day old French baguette (for topping)</li>
        <li>Gruyere cheese, shredded (for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing your onions. Peel them and then cut in half from pole to pole - through the root and stem. Remove the tough root part by cutting it away with your knife. Then thinly slice them pole to pole - like cutting with the grain of the onion. This gives the slices more structural integrity so that they stand up to the slow cooking method.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process with the rest of the onions.</li>
        <li>Next prepare your stock. Ideally you would use homemade beef stock, but you can also “soup” up a store bought version. To do that, add your beef broth to a stock pot and bring to a simmer. Add aromatics like parsley, sliced carrots, thyme sprigs, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, cloves, and parmesan rind. Let it simmer for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>In a large dutch oven drizzle 2-4 Tbsp olive oil and let heat up for one minute. Dump in the sliced onions. It will look like way too many, but just trust me.</li>
        <li>Slowly caramelize the onions over medium heat. Keep them moving constantly, and scrape down the sides of the pot. </li>
        <li>The onions are done when they are soft, jammy, and caramelized with a lot of fond on the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Add 2 Tbsp flour to the onions and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Deglaze the pot with 1 cup of dry sherry and cook, scraping up fond from the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Once the alcohol is cooked off, add the beef broth. Make sure to strain it first if you added aromatics.</li>
        <li>Let the whole thing simmer for 5-10 minutes to let the flavors get to know each other.</li>
        <li>Optional: add umami boosters. I like to add a splash of fish sauce and soy sauce to richen the flavors.</li>
        <li>Cut thick slices of day-old french baguette. Put them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and top with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Toast bread in a 400°F oven for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice a clove of garlic in half and rub down each piece of bread with the garlic.</li>
        <li>Check the soup for salt and pepper and season as necessary.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into broiler-safe cups. Top with sliced baguette and shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Put the bowls onto a baking sheet and put into an oven preheated to broil. Broil for 3-5 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chives and serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
